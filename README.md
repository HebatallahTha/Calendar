# 🗓️ React Weekly Calendar

> **A Week in the Life of Heba!**  
Join me on my journey as a CodePath student, Software Engineering intern, and caring daughter and sister — balancing tech, family, and fun every day! ✨

## 📌 Description

This project is a **React-based weekly calendar** that visually represents a full week’s schedule, Sunday through Saturday, from **8AM to 5PM**. Each hour block shows a custom activity — from coding and classes to prayer and journaling. It’s designed to help reinforce my React skills while reflecting my real-life routine!

## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 **React Components**: Built with reusable `Event` and `Calendar` components
- 🎨 **Color-coded events**: Each event block has a unique pastel color to distinguish categories
- 📅 **Full 7-day grid**: Covers every day of the week and every hour from 8AM to 5PM
- 🕋 **Faith + Tech**: Integrates daily prayers, Quran, and focused study into the schedule
- 💡 **Beginner-friendly**: Perfect practice project for anyone learning JSX and React fundamentals

## 💻 Tech Stack

- React.js
- CSS Modules
- Vite (or Create React App)
- Emoji-enhanced descriptions for accessibility & fun
